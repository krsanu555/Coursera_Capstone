    "In this project, we will determine neighbourhoods using location data(lattitude and longitude). Determining neighbourhoods mean to get to know about the amenities and venues exist in that neighbourhoods. These includes fast food joints,pharmacies,park,grad school and so on. Hence we can compare  different neighbourhoods in terms of service.\n",

And then, using a combination of location data and machine learning, we will group the neighborhoods into clusters like this."
